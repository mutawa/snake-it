# Snake It

Back in the 90s, I used to play a game developed for the MSX computer with the name [Snake It].
This is my attempt at re-creating the same game logic and game play on modern javascript equipped browsers.

One distinctive feature about this game is that the snake _does not_ automatically move to the last direction it was originally directed to. The player has to push the arrow keys on the keyboard so that the snake will move one tile at a time to that direction.

You might ask yourself, isn't that too easy?

Well, not if you find out the second distinctive feature of the game. The random food that appears for the snake will cause another type of food to appear once eaten. Once the snake eats the second type of food, a posionous food will appear randomly. The goal in each stage is to eat all of the green and white (safe) food, while avoiding the poisionous ones. The snake will die if it tries to eat its own body.

The player is discouraged from going on at a constant pace, since eating food might cause poison to appear right in front of the snake's head. Eating poison causes the snake to die.

Enjoy...
